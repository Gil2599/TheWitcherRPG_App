    <item>Cleansing Ritual:3:Cleansing Ritual cleanses
        one target\'s body of poisons or
        diseases. When activated, the caster makes a Ritual Crafting check
        against a specific DC to cleanse the
        target’s body. Alcohol and drugs
        are reasonably easy, with a DC of
        12. Poisons and oils are harder,
        with a DC of 15. Major illnesses
        are very difficult to cleanse, with a
        DC of 18. Cleansing Ritual cannot
        cure plagues such as Catriona.
        :5 Rounds:Variable:Immediate:Chalk (x2), Spirits
        (x1), Mistletoe (x2), Crow’s Eye
        (x1), Balisse Leaves (x1)</item>

        <item>Create Crystal Skull:5:By infusing an existing
            animal skull from a cat, dog, bird, or serpent
            with fifth essence you create a crystal skull
            which can be used to form a single animal of
            that type as per the Crystal Skull on pg.119.
            If the animal created by a Crystal Skull dies,
            the Crystal Skull can be recharged by performing
            this ritual again using only 2 units of Fifth
            Essence and the inactive skull.
        :10 Rounds:14:Immediate:Animal Skull, Fifth Essence (x5):toc</item>

        <item>Hydromancy:5:Hydromancy allows you
            to stare into a small body of water
            and glimpse an event that happened within the last two days
            or that is currently happening.
            Watching an event in the past uses
            the base DC. If you are trying to
            glimpse an event that is currently
            happening, increase the DC by 3
            points. If you are viewing a current
            event, a magician present at that
            event can sense the augury with a
            Magic Training roll that beats your
            Ritual Crafting roll.
            :5 Rounds:15 (18):Active (2 STA):A Small Body of
            Water or a Bowl of Water, Fifth
            Essence (x2), White Myrtle Petals
            (x2), Pearl (x2), Lunar Shards (x1),
            Berbercane Fruit (x1)</item>

        <item>Imbue Trophy:3:By properly preparing and taxidermizing
            the remains of a monster, this ritual allows you to make
            use of a monster\'s alien physiology to channel magical
            effects. Upon performing this ritual, a single non-enchanted
            trophy you possess becomes a permanent magical trophy
            that grants the benefits listed on pg.124 to
            anyone who carries the trophy who also helped kill the monster.
        :10 Rounds:12:Immediate:Monster Trophy, Fifth Essence (x1),
            Infused Dust (x1), Tanning Herbs (x10), Ogre Wax (x1), Ester Grease (x2):toc</item>

        <item>Magical Message:3:Magical Message records a
            message of up to 5 minutes into a
            gemstone or piece of glass etched
            with a magical sigil. You can set
            up to 3 specific triggers that activate the message. Once played,
            the message goes dormant until another trigger occurs. When
            triggered, an illusion of the caster
            appears and gives the message.
            When crafted with a perfect gemstone, the message appears as clear
            as if the ritual crafter were truly
            there.
            :5 Rounds:12:Permanent:Glass (x1), Fifth
            Essence (x1), Quicksilver Solution
            (x1)</item>

        <item>Pyromancy:5:Pyromancy allows you to
            stare into a burning fire and witness events that are currently
            happening. Pyromancy is more dangerous than Hydromancy, making
            it harder to maintain and impossible to peer backwards. However,
            it is easier to view events that are
            currently happening. Similarly to
            Hydromancy, a mage you view
            can sense the augury with a Magic
            Training roll that beats your Ritual
            Crafting roll.
            :5 Rounds:15:Active (4 STA):A Small Fire, Fifth
            Essence (x2), Ashes (x2), Calcium
            Equum (x5), Crow’s Eye (x2), Wax (x2)</item>

        <item>Ritual of Life:5:The Ritual of Life creates
            a magic circle which influences
            the healing capabilities of a target within it.
            The circle grants regeneration of 3 Health Points per
            turn. This regeneration lasts for 10
            rounds, and only while the target
            remains in the circle. If the target
            leaves the circle it disappears.
            :5 Rounds:15:One Use:Chalk (x2), Ashes
            (x2), Wax (x2), Mandrake Root (x2)</item>

        <item>Ritual of Magic:3:The Ritual of Magic creates
            a magic circle which bolsters magical
            tolerance, granting a bonus to
            Vigor Threshold equal to half the
            caster’s Ritual Crafting skill value.
            This benefit is bestowed on the
            first person with magical ability to
            enter the circle and focus on it, and
            lasts for 5 hours. Alternatively, the
            caster can expend the circle to gain
            1d6/2 units of Fifth Essence.
            :5 Rounds:15:One Use:Chalk (x2), Glass
            (x2), Sulfur (x2), Infused Dust (x1)</item>

        <item>Spell Jar:5:Spell Jar creates a magical
            vortex inside a sealed clay jar. This
            magical vortex lasts for 1d6 days
            and activates when the jar is broken. When broken, the magical
            vortex opens and a random spell
            from the list below occurs. Roll
            1d10/2 -
            1. Talfryn’s Prison
            2. Zephyr
            3. Tanio Ilchar
            4. Dormyn’s Fog
            5. Static Storm
            :5 Rounds:15:1d6 Days:River Clay (x5),
            Fifth Essence (x1), Thread (x2),

            (x2), Infused Dust (x1)</item>

        <item>Spirit Seance:5:Spirit Seance contacts the
            spirit of a dead person. The seance
            brings the soul back as a specter
            with the sentience of the original person. The specter retains all
            memories, including the memory
            of their death, and can be spoken
            with at its burial site. The specter
            cannot be sent back to the realm of
            the dead except at its own choice,
            or by killing it. The Seance will
            summon the spirits of anyone of
            the same bloodline within 20m so
            using this spell in family crypts is
            not advised.
            :5 Rounds:12:Permanent:Some Blood of the
            Deceased or a Relative, Mandrake
            Root (x1), Sewant Mushrooms
            (x2), Wolfsbane (x2), Sulfur (x2)</item>

        <item>Telecommunication:3:A Telecommunicator allows you to communicate with
            another person with a Telecommunicator. The ritual is simple but
            requires both participants to have
            a telecommunicator and perform
            the ritual. However it allows you
            to communicate across tremendous distances,
            allowing communication between all parts of the
            known Continent.
            :5 Rounds:None:1 Hour:A Telecommunicator</item>

        <item>Tyromancy:2:By magically aging or melting cheese and
            watching closely its qualities, Tyromancy allows you to
            divine whether a course of action will have a positive
            or negative outcome. When the ritual is performed, the
            GM privately rolls 1d6 and either adds or subtracts it
            from 13 to determine the DC of the ritual. If the cheese
            used is of standard quality or lower (10 Crowns per Unit)
            the d6 is added to 13. If the cheese used is of high
            quality (30 Crowns per Unit) the d6 is subtracted. You
            then make a Ritual Crafting check against this DC. After
            the check, you may ask the GM whether a course of action
            will have a positive or negative outcome. If your check
            was successful, the GM must answer truthfully. If the
            outcome of the action would be both positive and negative,
            the answer is whichever would be more immediate. If you
            fail, the GM will give you a false answer based on the
            private roll of their d6. If the number was odd the false
            answer is negative, if the number was even, the false
            answer is positive.
        :5 Rounds:13 +/- 1d6:Immediate:Cheese (x2):toc</item>

        <item>Wagerer\'s Pendant:6:By binding a shard of etched
            glass in a pendant of wolfsbane, beast bones,
            and leather strips, you can create a locus of
            dark magic. This pendant absorbs the chaos
            which forms hexes and temporarily stores it.
            While a person wears it, they are freed from
            the effects of all hexes. If the pendant is
            removed at any point, all of the effects return.
            Additionally, if the person fails to rid
            themselves of all of the hexes by the end of
            this ritual\'s duration, the pendant breaks and
            releases a torrent of dark magic. Should this
            occur, the person wearing the pendant and
            anyone within 2m of them are immediately afflicted
            by a number of hexes chosen by the GM.
        :10 Rounds:14:1 Week:Glass (x2), Beast Bones (x1),
            Wolfsbane (x2), Leather (x2), Chalk (x2),

        <item>Animate Armor:14:By assembling a full suit of
            armor with a golem heart at its core and infusing
            the heart with magic you can animate the suit
            of armor as a loyal servant. Upon performing this
            ritual, the suit of armor you used becomes animate
            and uses the living armor stat block (pg. 204)
            except for its armor Stopping Power which is
            equal to the armor you used. The living armor
            is not a sapient creature and is eternally
            loyal to its creator. It will perform any
            task given by its creator to the letter.

        <item>Beacon of the Unnatural:12:By constructing a grim
            totem containing a fifth essence infused mutagen
            you create a beacon for monsters. Upon performing
            this ritual, the Beacon of the Unnatural calls
            to any monsters within 1 mile to come and build
            a new nest at the location. The scent given off
            by the Beacon grows stronger over time, expanding
            the range of its draw by a mile every year. The
            Beacon is 2m tall and has 20 Hit Points.

            A Mutagen, Rope, Beast Bones (x5), Fifth Essence (x1):toc</item>

    <item>Consecrate:12:Consecrate creates a magic circle which temporarily repels
        monsters. This circle can be up to
        10m in radius and forces any monster that tries to enter the area to
        roll a Resist Magic check at a DC
        equal to the Ritual Crafting check
        used to create the circle. Spell effects generated
        by monsters cannot enter the circle, but non-magical
        projectiles thrown by monsters ignore it.
        A monster that makes
        a successful roll to enter the circle
        can remain in it, but must make
        another roll to exit the circle. If
        you are using the traditional rules
        for monster vulnerabilities, you
        must use silver for monsters vulnerable to silver and meteorite for
        monsters vulnerable to meteorite.
        :10 Rounds:18:Until Dispelled:Fifth Essence (x5),
        Infused Dust (x2), Chalk (x4), Silver or Meteorite (x5)</item>

        <item>Fog of the Past:10:By arranging a circle of candles,
            creating a pyramidal sculpture of glass with a lunar
            shard in its center, and filling it with essence of
            wraith you create a magical projector which summons
            up a vision of the past. Upon performing this ritual,
            the projector shows the most emotionally resonant
            moment to have ever occurred in the area. This moment
            can be up to 5 minutes long and plays on repeat
            until the end of the ritual.

        <item>Magic Barrier:10:Magic Barrier creates a
            circular barrier of pure force that
            is 10m in diameter. This barrier
            takes 50 Health Points before it is
            destroyed. On your turn you can
            spend an additional STA point on
            top of the active cost to regenerate
            Health Points in the shield at a rate
            of 5 Health per STA point.
            This shield is solid and
            impassible to any solid object.
            Once the shield has been erected,
            nothing can enter. Air is replenished within the shield, so those
            within can breathe. If a mage
            wishes, they can stop this replenishment, leaving only 20 rounds
            of air. For every extra person in
            the shield the rounds of air are reduced by 1. Ethereal creatures can
            pass through this shield, and you
            can teleport in or out.

        <item>Magical Guestbook:8:By weaving symbols in chalk
            and coal on an archway or door frame and placing
            a small fifth-essence-infused clay icon on the top
            of the entryway you create an invisible curtain.
            This magical curtain records the faces of anyone who
            passes through and alerts you telepathically if
            anyone you designated when you cast the ritual pass
            through it. The curtain keeps the recordings of the
            faces until the ritual ends, after which they
            are stored in the clay icon which can be viewed
            by someone with a Vigor Threshold of 1 or higher.
            These recordings remain as long as the icon
            remains intact. While the ritual is active, you
            can access the records at any time telepathically
            while within 100m. You must also be within
            100m for the Magical Guestbook to alert you
            to a designated person entering.

        <item>Oneiromancy:8:Oneiromancy grants the
            caster a dream which unveils secrets and events of the past and
            present. A caster can perform the
            ritual alone, much like Hydromancy. It also requires a Ritual Casting
            check to witness events that have
            occurred previously and a more
            difficult DC to witness events
            that are occurring at the moment.
            Oneiromancy can be detected like Hydromancy.
            However the Oneiromancer can also guide a number
            of people equal to their Ritual
            Crafting skill value to share their
            enlightening dream. To do this,
            the oneiromancer must make a
            bond with the people they want
            to enlighten. This requires the
            participants to answer a series of
            personal questions, as truthfully
            as possible. The dream lasts for the
            duration of the ritual.

        <item>Artifact Compression:16:Artifact Compression converts a target creature within 10m
            to 1/10th original scale and encases them in jade.
            While in the statuette this target is unconscious. The
            process of transformation is excruciatingly painful for the target
            and the target must make a DC of 15
            Endurance check or take 6d6 damage to their torso.
            A target can be kept in a
            state of Artifact Compression for
            an indefinite amount of time and
            their body is held in suspension so
            they don’t age. While in condensed
            form, a target has 1/5th (rounded
            up) their normal Health Points. If
            these points are expended the target dies. If a limb is
            broken off, either with a DC of 14 Physique check
            or 5 points of damage, the target
            is treated as if that limb was dismembered. If the head is snapped
            off, the target dies. Gluing pieces
            back onto a compressed figurine
            doesn’t reattach the limb. After a
            target is uncompressed they are
            stunned until they make a successful Stun save.

            on a standing stone erected at the confluence of two
            ley lines of the same element you create a Place of
            Power. This Place of Power remains indefinitely.
            If you fumble when performing this ritual your
            fumble outcome always results in a 10 and all
            of the stone used for the ritual explodes as if
            it were a bomb (doing 7d6 damage) with a 6m radius.

        <item>Enchant Amulet:Variable:By inlaying a common amulet
            with gemstones etched with magic glyphs you create an
            enchanted amulet that stores the knowledge of casting
            certain spells. When creating a magic amulet, a
            character must spend the required STA for each spell
            cast. If a spell has an active duration, the caster
            must also spend enough STA to sustain it for 4 rounds.
            When creating an amulet, the caster may not use a
            magical focus. Every spell to be imbued in the amulet
            must be cast quickly in succession, without taking
            any other action in-between, otherwise the
            Crafting process fails.

        <item>Golem Crafting:15:Golem Crafting creates a
            golem that serves the caster until it
            dies. The process creates a simple
            golem that is bound to your will.
            It will do anything that you ask it
            to, but it cannot think and can’t
            perform finesse tasks that require

            A golem will execute the last order
            it was given. If it fails, it will try
            again endlessly until it succeeds or
            you order it to stop. If the order is
            ongoing (“fetch some water”) the
            golem will continue to perform
            that order until it dies or you order
            it to stop.

        <item>Interactive Illusion:12:Interactive Illusion creates an illusion with sight, sound,
            smell, and tangible feelings. Nothing about the illusion is real but it
            all feels real to anyone who enters
            its area. The illusion covers a 20m
            radius and its caster actively controls and shapes it. If they create a
            danger within the illusion to battle
            intruders, each intruder may make
            a Magic Resistance or Endurance
            check at DC of 12. If they succeed,
            they realize that nothing is actually happening to them and take no
            damage. If they fail they think that
            the damage is real, and must roll a
            Stun save. The damage cannot kill
            but it can stun.
