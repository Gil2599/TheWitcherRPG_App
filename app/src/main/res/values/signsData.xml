        <item>Yrden:Variable:Yrden creates a large magic
            circle on the ground around you.
            Anything that steps into that circle
            takes a negative to SPD and REF
            (equal to the number of STA you
            spent) until they exit the circle.
            Any incorporeal creatures that enter
            the circle become corporeal.
            :3m:5 Rounds:None:Mixed Element</item>

        <item>Quen:Variable: Quen creates a shield with
            5 Health Points per point of Stamina spent to protect you. If you
            fail (or choose not to or are unable to) to defend against an attack
            or effect which causes damage,
            the damage is first applied to the
            Quen shield. Lethal and non-lethal
            damage reduce the Quen shieldâ€™s
            Health Points equally. If the shield
            is reduced to 0 Health any remaining damage is applied to you as per
            normal and must penetrate your
            armor and damage resistances
            to impact your Health Points or
            Stamina just like any other attack.
            Quen can be used to defend against any spell which can be
            Blocked but is ineffective against
            damage caused by spells which
            cannot be Blocked or against
            damage caused by already being
            poisoned, having a disease, or suffocation due to a lack of oxygen in
            the surrounding area.
             You cannot cast Quen
            again until your current Quen
            shield has been exhausted or the
            duration ends.
            :Self:10 rounds or until exhausted:None:Earth</item>

        <item>Aard:Variable:Aard shoots a wave of
            telekinetic force, staggering creatures
            with a 10% chance of those affected
            being knocked prone. The percentage rises
            by 10% for each point of STA spent.
            :2m Cone:Immediate:Dodge:Air</item>

        <item>Igni:Variable:Igni throws out a wave of
            sparks and fire which does 1d6
            damage per STA point spent and
            has a 50% chance of lighting anything it
            hits on fire. Igni always
            deals damage to the torso unless
            used at point blank range. When
            used at point blank range Igni can
            be aimed at body locations.
            :2m Cone:Immediate:Dodge or Block:Fire</item>

        <item>Axii:Variable:Axii stuns an opponent
            until they can make Stun save at -1.
            For every 2 points of additional
            STA you spend past 1, the Stun
            save becomes harder by 1 point.

    <string-array name="alternate_signs_list_data">

        <item>Magic Trap:Variable:Yrden now creates a magical trap that takes one round to
            prepare. This trap attacks using
            your Spell Casting and WILL and
            does 3d6 damage. The trap will
            make one attack against the closest
            enemy each round.
            :3m Radius:1 Round per STA point:Dodge or Block:Mixed Element</item>

        <item>Active Shield:Variable:Quen now creates
            a glowing shield around you. The shield
            has 10 HP for every Stamina point
            spent. Each round after the first,
            you must spend a number of STA
            points equal to the initial STA
            cost to maintain the shield. Active
            Shield only covers you, but you
            can fit one other person into it if
            you are pressed together. While in
            the active shield nothing tangible
            can pass in or out without destroying
            the shield first and you must
            move slowly to keep the shield up,
            meaning you cannot run. When
            the shield is expended or dropped,
            anything adjacent to you is pushed
            back 2m and takes 1d6 damage to
            the torso. This includes objects,
            furniture, and allies. Anything
            rooted to the ground or heavier
            than 226kg is not pushed back but
            still takes damage.
            :Self:Active (Initial STA):None:Earth</item>

        <item>Aard Sweep:Variable:Aard now shoots a burst of
            telekinetic force around you. For
            each STA point spent, everything
            caught in the burst has a 10%
            chance of being knocked to the
            ground and staggered. The burst
            travels out in all directions as a
            sphere. Flying creatures struck
            with Aard Sweep are knocked out
            of the air as well as being knocked down.
            :4m Radius:Immediate:Dodge:Air</item>

        <item>Fire Stream:Variable:Igni now throws
            out a constant stream of fire and sparks
            from your hand which does 1d6
            damage per STA point spent, and
            has a 75% chance of lighting the
            opponent on fire. Fire Stream
            must be maintained every round
            with a number of STA points equal
            to 1/2 the number of STA points
            spent to cast the sign. You can
            switch targets on your turn and
            the stream can be aimed at body
            locations.
            :3m:Active (1/2 Initial STA):Dodge or Block:Fire</item>

        <item>Puppet:Variable:Axii now controls
            an opponent\'s mind, making them your
            ally for a number of rounds equal
            to the number of STA points you
            spent on the spell. Each round, the
            target can make a Resist Magic roll
            against your Spell Casting roll to
            try and free themselves.
