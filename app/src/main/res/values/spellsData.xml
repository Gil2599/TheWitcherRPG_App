            mirror creates 1d10 illusory copies
            of the caster. These copies are
            intangible, but indistinguishable
            from the caster and controlled by
            the caster’s mind. Controlling the
            copies does not require an action
            but they cannot leave the spell\’s

            SPD. Small structures on the shattered
            ground have a 10% chance of

            the spell’s area must make an Athletics
            roll or sink into the crumbling ground,
            which causes them to suffocate until
            they make a successful Athletics check

            spell. While suffocating, a target is
            treated as staggered.

            flaming tornado 2m wide. You can
            direct the tornado to move a number
            of meters equal to your Spell
            Casting skill value per turn. If it
            runs over or into a target, make
            a Spell Casting roll versus their
            Dodge/Escape roll. If they fail,
            they take 5d6 damage and have a
            50% chance of being set on fire.
            The vortex will not travel beyond

            is grappled and on fire until
            they make a Dodge/Escape check
            vs. your Spell Casting roll. Every
            round that the target fails the
            Dodge/Escape check, the DC rises

            spell does 4d6 damage which cannot be blocked by
            armor or shields. The extreme dehydration
            creates a fatigue which
            lowers the target\'s current STA by
            4d6 as well.

            of a target. This command must be
            executed to the letter by the target.

            from you. Stepping through this
            portal teleports you anywhere you
            can recall. The portal can transport
            anything that fits through it. If you
            end the portal while something is
            partially through, the portal slices
            the object (or creature) in two.
            The person is counted as being
            dismembered, as per the Critical
            Wound. You can create a portal to
            a location you don’t know as per

            of that animal (See Bestiary,
            pg.310). Any items on your person
            transform with you. You must cast

            Gwynt Troelli and acts a Zephyr
            spell against anyone within 2m of
            you. You cannot run while within this tornado, or make attacks

            2m of a target they are effected by
            Zephyr.

            be dodged and blocked (destroying whatever blocks it)
            but it cannot be displaced by wind and can only be parried by a reflective
            surface, which still takes damage. Tge reflected laser goes off in a random
            direction. This spell uses the rays of the sun and cannot be used where the
            sun’s rays can’t penetrate. By the light of the moon or on overcast days, it
            does half damage.

        <item>Part Water:25:Part Water allows you to create an open area in a body of water, up
            to 10m by 100m by 10m. Fish, monsters, and other creatures in the water
            are swept back with the water. You can pass in and out of the wall as easily
            as stepping in or out of a body of water without disturbing the walls. If used
            while in the water the effect pushes the caster aside as well. The area can
            be summoned in any orientation, even vertical.

            armor, freeze the opponent and do 2 point of damage each round until they
            are broken off with a DC 20 Physique check or by doing 20 points of damage
            to them. Otherwise, these spikes last for the duration of the spell. Each
            attack resolves separately.
