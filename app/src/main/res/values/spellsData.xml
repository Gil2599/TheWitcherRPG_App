        <item>Afan\'s Mirror:3:Created by the talented
            Aedirnian mage Afan of Gulet, Afan\'s
            mirror creates 1d10 illusory copies
            of the caster. These copies are
            intangible, but indistinguishable
            from the caster and controlled by
            the caster’s mind. Controlling the
            copies does not require an action
            but they cannot leave the spell\’s
            range.

            used as a defensive action to block
            magic attacks with or without

            a magical effect you must spend
            half as many Stamina points as the
            caster spent to cast the magic and
