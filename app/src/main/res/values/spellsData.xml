        <item>Afan\'s Mirror:3:Created by the talented
            Aedirnian mage Afan of Gulet, Afan\'s
            mirror creates 1d10 illusory copies
            of the caster. These copies are
            intangible, but indistinguishable
            from the caster and controlled by
            the caster’s mind. Controlling the
            copies does not require an action
            but they cannot leave the spell\’s
            range.

        <item>Blinding Dust:3:Blinding Dust allows you to
            shoot a magical dust into the eyes
            of a target that blinds them for the

        <item>Dispel:Variable:Dispel allows you to end a
            spell/ritual/hex within the range
            of this spell. This spell can cancel
            magic with a duration and can be
            used as a defensive action to block
            magic attacks with or without
            physical components. To cancel
            a magical effect you must spend
            half as many Stamina points as the
            caster spent to cast the magic and
            make a Spell Casting roll that beats
            their casting roll.

            Eilhart, this gruesome spell allows you
            to dig into a target\’s mind and tear out
