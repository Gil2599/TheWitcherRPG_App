         1. Defining Skill\n
        Each profession has a defining skill. This
        one skill separates this profession from all
        of the others—an ability that only a person
        with years of training in that field can acquire.
        The defining skill is counted in the
        profession skill package when buying skills.\n\n

        2. Vigor\n
        Each profession has a starting allowance of
        Vigor, which represents how much primal
        chaos you can channel through your body
        safely to cast spells, perform rituals, and
        inflict hexes.\n\n

        3. Magic Perks\n
        Professions with inherent magic have magic
        perks. These are spells, incantations, hexes,
        rituals, and signs.\n\n

        4. Skill Package\n
        Each profession has a skill package which
        represents general learning over the course
        of an apprenticeship.\n\n

        5. Starting Gear\n
        Each profession has starting gear that you
        can choose from. This are items that you
        would probably have and use in your daily
        life, working in that profession.\n\n

    <string-array name="defSkills_data_array">

        <item>Busking (EMP):A Bard is a wonderful thing to have around,
            especially when the party’s low on money. A
            Bard can take an hour and make a Busking
            roll in the nearest town center. The total of
            this roll is the amount of money raked in by
            the Bard while they perform on the street. A
            fumble can lower the roll, and a negative value
            means that not only do you fail to make any
            coin but you are also harassed by the locals
            for your poor performance, resulting in a -2
            to Charisma with anyone in the town for the
            rest of the day</item>

        <item>Practiced Paranoia (INT):Whether they’re an assassin, a thief,
            a counterfeiter, or a smuggler, criminals all share a practiced
            paranoia that keeps them out of trouble.
            Whenever a Criminal comes within 10m of a
            trap (this includes experimental traps, Man at
            Arms booby traps, and ambushes) they immediately can make a Practiced Paranoia roll at
            either the DC to spot the trap, the ambushing
            party’s Stealth roll, or a DC set by the GM.
            Even if they don’t succeed in spotting the trap,
            they are still aware that something is wrong</item>

        <item>Patch Job (CRA):A skilled craftsman can patch a weapon or
            armor well enough to keep it working and
            keep its wearer/wielder in the fight, whether
            that be by tying a bowstring back together, sharpening the edge of a broken blade or
            nailing a plate over a cracked shield. By taking
            a turn to roll Patch Job at a DC equal to the
            item’s Crafting DC -3 a Craftsman can restore
            a broken shield or armor to 1/2 its full SP or
            restore a broken weapon to 1/2 its durability.
            Until fixed at a forge, a patched weapon does
            half its normal damage.</item>

        <item>Healing Hands (CRA):Anyone can apply some ointment and wrap
            a bandage around a cut, but a Doctor has
            true medical training which allows them to
            perform complex surgeries. A Doctor with
            Healing Hands is the only person who can
            heal a critical wound. To heal critical wounds
            a doctor must make a number of successful
            Healing Hands rolls based on the severity of
            the critical wound. The DC of the roll is based
            on the severity of the critical wound as well.
            Healing Hands can also be used for any First
            Aid task.</item>

        <item>Magic Training (INT):To qualify as a Mage a magically
            adept person must pass through the halls of one of the
            world’s magical academies and learn the
            fundamentals of the magical arts. A Mage can roll
            Magical Training whenever they encounter
            a magical phenomenon, an unknown spell,
            or a question of magical theory. The DC is set
            by the GM, and a success allows the Mage to
            learn everything there is to know about the
            phenomenon. Magical Training can also
            be rolled as a form of Awareness that detects
            magic that is in use, or specters.</item>

        <item>Tough As Nails (BODY):True Men At Arms like the Blue
            Stripes of Temeria and the Impera Brigade of Nilfgaard are
            hardened soldiers who never give in or surrender.
            When a Man At Arms falls to or below 0 Health, they can roll Tough As Nails at
            a DC equal to the number of negative Health
            times 2 to keep fighting. If they fail, they fall
            into death state as per usual. If they succeed
            they can keep fighting as if they were only at
            their Wound Threshold. Any damage forces
            them to make another roll against a DC based
            on their Health.</item>

        <item>Initiate of the Gods (EMP):The churches of the world are often warm
            and inviting places, helping their communities and welcoming new converts. A Priest
            can roll Initiate of the Gods at a DC set by
            the GM at churches of the same faith to get
            free lodging, healing, and other services at
            the GM’s discretion. Initiate of the Gods also
            works when dealing with members of the
            same faith, though they will likely be able to
            offer less than a fully supplied church. Keep in
            mind that Initiate of the Gods does not work
            with members of other faiths.</item>

        <item>Witcher Training (INT):Most of a Witcher’s early life is spent within
            the walls of their keep, studying huge, dusty
            tomes and going through hellish combat
            training. Many have argued that the Witcher’s
            greatest weapon is their knowledge of monsters
            and their adaptability in any situation.
            When in a hostile environment or difficult
            terrain, a Witcher can lessen the penalties by
            half their Witcher Training value (minimum
            1). Witcher Training can also be used in any
            situation that you would normally use Monster Lore for</item>

        <item>Well Traveled (INT):Your average merchant makes a living from
            trade and that trade brings in customers
            from all around. But a traveling merchant
            goes to their customers, wandering the roads
            of the world, and learning from it’s people.
            A Merchant can make a Well Traveled roll
            anytime they want to know a fact about a
            specific item, culture, or area. The DC is set
            by the GM and if the roll is successful the
            Merchant remembers the answer to that
            question, calling on memories of the last time
            they travelled through the applicable area.</item>

    <string-array name="bard_skills_info">

        <item>Return Act (EMP):Before attempting a Busking
            roll a Bard can roll Return Act
            at a DC set by the GM to see
            whether they have played in
            this town before. If the roll is
            successful the Bard has made
            a name for themselves in this
            town already. Not only is their
            Busking income doubled but
            they gain a +2 Charisma with
            everyone in at that venue.</item>

        <item>Raise A Crowd (EMP):By taking a full round
            to perform, you can roll Raise A
            Crowd to captivate anyone
            within 20m. Anyone who
            doesn’t make a Resist Coercion
            roll higher than your initial roll
            can do nothing but watch you
            perform until they succeed at
            rolling above your initial roll. If
            attacked a target will snap out
            of it.</item>

        <item>Good Friend (EMP):Once per session a Bard can
            make a Good Friend roll to
            find a friend to aid them. Take
            the total roll and split these
            points up between the 3 categories in the Good Friend
            chart in the sidebar. This is friend
            will do one reasonable thing
            for old times’ sake, then cannot
            be called on again for free and
            must be convinced.</item>

        <item>Fade (INT):A Bard can make a Fade
            roll against multiple targets’
            Awareness rolls to fade into
            the background. This ability allows a Bard to hide even
            when there are no good hiding
            places, by slipping into a conversation, drawing attention to
            something else, or the like. This
            ability doesn’t work if you are
            wearing really flashy clothing.</item>

        <item>Spread The Word (INT):A Bard who rolls a successful
            Deceit roll against a target can
            then roll Spread the Word
            against the target’s Resist Coercion roll. If they succeed the
            target spreads the Bard’s lie
            around the target’s settlement
            or group, giving the Bard a +2
            to Deceit when trying to pass
            off that lie again to someone
            else.</item>

        <item>Acclimatize (INT):When in a settlement a Bard
            can roll Acclimatize (See Acclimatize chart for DC).
            If successful, the Bard learns how to
            appear as a local and will no
            longer be treated as an outsider. This grants
            a +2 to Charisma and Persuasion with locals
            and means that they won’t be
            questioned or harassed like an
            outsider.</item>

        <item>Poison The Well (EMP):A Bard can make a Poison
            The Well roll against a target’s
            EMPx3 when they are trying to influence a person or
            people. If successful, the Bard
            makes a pointed comment that
            imposes a -1 for each point
            they rolled above the DC to the
            target’s Seduction, Persuasion,
            Leadership, Intimidation or
            Charisma rolls.</item>

        <item>Needling (EMP):A Bard can make a Needling
            roll against a target’s Resist
            Coercion roll. If successful,
            the bard goads them with obscenities and threats until they
            attack. The target takes a negative to their attack and defense
            equal to half the Bard’s Needling value, lasting for as many
            rounds as the Needling value.</item>

        <item>Et Tu Brute (EMP):A Bard can roll Et Tu Brute
            against a target’s WILLx3 to
            turn them against one ally. If
            successful the Bard’s lies and
            half-truths makes the target
            treat that ally with mistrust and
            animosity for as many days as
            the Et Tu Brute value or until
            they make a Resist Coercion
            roll that beats the Et Tu Brute
            roll.</item>

    </string-array>

    <string-array name="craftsman_skills_info">

        <item>Extensive Catalogue (INT):A skilled Craftsman can keep a
            mental catalogue of diagrams
            in their head at all times. When
            a Craftsman has memorized
            as many diagrams as they can,
            they may roll Extensive Catalogue at DC:15 to memorize
            one more. There is no limit, but
            every 10 diagrams they have
            memorized adds 1 to the DC.</item>

        <item>Journeyman (CRA):A Craftsman who begins crafting
            an item can roll Journeyman at a DC equal to the item’s
            crafting DC. If they succeed
            they add +1 DMG for weapons
            or +1 SP for armor for every
            2 points they rolled above the
            DC. The maximum bonus
            they can give to DMG or SP is 5.</item>

        <item>Master Crafting (CRA):Master Crafting allows a
            Craftsman to make items that
            are master grade. They can also
            roll a Master Crafting roll at
            any time at a DC equal to the
            item’s crafting DC to permanently grant armor resistance
            (their choice which) or weapons a 50% bleeding or -2 Stun
            value based on damage type. </item>

        <item>Mental Pharmacy (INT):A skilled Craftsman can keep
            a mental catalogue of formulae
            in their head at all times. When
            a Craftsman has memorized
            as many formulae as they can,
            they may roll Mental Pharmacy at DC:15 to memorize one
            more. There is no limit, but
            every 10 formulae they have
            memorized adds 1 to the DC.</item>

        <item>Double Dose (CRA):Any time a craftsman sets out
            to make an alchemical item
            they can make a Double Dose
            roll at a DC equal to the formula’s crafting DC. If they succeed
            they create two units of the
            formula with the ingredients
            of one. This applies to all items
            created with alchemy, including potions, oils, decoctions,
            and bombs.</item>

        <item>Adaptation (CRA):Craftsmen can roll
            an Adaptation check (3 + the crafting
            DC) before making a witcher
            potion to lower its DC to avoid
            poisoning by 1 for every point
            over the crafting DC. If they
            fail, the potion comes out as
            poisonous as it normally would
            be. The DC to avoid poisoning
            can never be lower than 12.</item>

        <item>Augmentation (CRA):A Craftsman can make an
            Augmentation roll at a DC
            listed in the Augmentation
            chart to augment a weapon
            or Armor with their crafting
            tools. This augmentation takes
            3 rounds. While a forge isn’t required,
            it grants a +2 to the roll.
            A fumble results in the item
            taking damage equal to the
            fumble value.</item>

        <item>Silver Coating (CRA):A Craftsman can
            coat an existing weapon in silver with a
            forge and a number of units
            of silver ingots based on the
            size of the weapon. The DC for
            this roll is 16. If you succeed,
            add +1d6 silver damage to a
            weapon per 3 points you rolled

            with a DC equal an item’s crafting
            DC to search for a flaw in
            the item’s design. This takes 1
            turn of studying, but allows the
            Craftsman to make a targeted
            attack at a -6 to do ablation
            damage to the armor or weapon equal to half their Pinpoint

            roll and split the points between the 3 categories in the
            Go To Ground table in the

            Spot against a sentient target’s
            Deceit roll to identify the target’s most valued possession

            Criminal a +1 to Intimidate

        <item>Rally (WILL):Once per day, by taking an

            not in active combat and takes a round

            REFx3 to gain a bonus on

            in place of an attack to temporarily blind a target. Eye Gouge

            a DC determined by the GM.
            If they succeed they assess
            any Critical Wounds the subject has and learn how many
            Health Points it has left. This
            also gives a +2 to any Healing

            wounds.</item>

        <item>Analysis (INT):When about to perform a
            Healing Hands roll, a Doctor
            can take a turn to make an
            Analysis roll at a DC equal
            to the severity of the Critical
            Wound. If they succeed they
            gain insight into the wounds,

            to heal a Critical Wound a Doctor can make
            an Effective Surgery roll at a
            DC equal to the wound’s Healing Hands DC. If they succeed
            they treat the wounds so skilfully that they heal twice as

            critical wounds and can also be
            used on regular wounds.</item>

            to roll against a DC set by the
            GM to create a covered area
            that provides an optimal medical environment. This takes 1
            hour but adds +3 to Healing
            Hands/First Aid rolls inside,
            and +2 to the healing rate of
            anyone in the tent for a number of days equal to your Healing Tent value.</item>

            to the crafting DC for a specific medical alchemical item to
            substitute something else on
            hand for the same effect. This
            roll takes one round and if it
            is failed it can be made again.

            was put into it (see the Healing
            Remedy chart in the sidebar).
            Each remedy remains viable
            for 3 days and must be burned

            only 1 use. Making a remedy takes 1 turn</item>

        <item>Bleeding Wound (INT):A Doctor who does damage
            with a bladed weapon can
            make a Bleeding Wound roll
            against a DC of 15. On success,
            the attack causes bleeding at
            a rate of 1 point per 2 points

            roll.</item>

        <item>Practical Carnage (INT):A Doctor can roll Practical
            Carnage against a DC equal

        <item>Crippling Wound (INT):A Doctor can make a Crippling
            Wound roll against the
            target’s defense. This attack
            takes a -6 to hit but imposes
            a negative to the target’s REFLEX, BODY, or SPEED equal
            to 1 per 3 points above their

            of days equal to the Mage’s
            Scheming value</item>

        <item>Grape Vine (INT):A Mage can take 1 hour and
            make a Grape Vine roll against
            a target’s EMPx3. Success
            spreads rumors throughout a

            your Grape Vine value for a
            number of days equal to your
            Grape Vine value.</item>

        <item>Assets (INT):Once per game a Mage can
            make an Assets roll to remember an asset they ‘acquired’
            some time ago. Take the total of your roll and distribute
            it between the 4 columns on
            the table in the sidebar to find
            out who you know. This asset
            will help you, but how much
            depends on their relationship
            with you.</item>

        <item>Reverse Engineer (INT):By taking 1
            hour to study an alchemical solution a Mage can
            roll Reverse Engineer at a DC
            equal to the Crafting DC for
            the alchemical item +3. Success allows them to
            reverse-engineer and write down the
            item’s formula. this formula is
            3 points harder to craft , but reliably

        <item>Distillation (CRA):A Mage can roll Distillation
            instead of Alchemy when creating an alchemical solution.
            Success at this roll creates a
            dose of that solution that has
            half again the effect that it
            would normally have, either

            to mutate the subject. Success
            grants the subject use of the
            Mutagen with the appropriate minor mutation. Failure
            throws the subject into Death
            State and inflicts the larger mutation.</item>

        <item>In Touch:As a Mage utilizes magic
            more and more, their body
            becomes more used to the
            flow. Every point a Mage has
            in In Touch grants +2 points
            to Vigor threshold. When this
            ability reaches level 10 your
            maximum Vigor threshold

            DC-16 whenever they would
            normally be affected by dimeritium.
            Success means that
            the Mage mostly shrugs off
            the dimeritium. They are still
            somewhat dizzy and uncomfortable but retain half of their

            spell or ritual, at a DC of 16.
            On success the mage can channel the spell or ritual through

            the person will spy on a
            target for as many days as your
            Insider value. At the end of
            this time you can roll again, but
            must pay again.</item>

        <item>Treasure Map (INT):Once per session a Merchant
            can roll Treasure Map at a DC
            set by the GM to remember
            the supposed location of a relic
            item, or a ruin that may hide
            something useful. This location will, of course, be out of
            the way or exceedingly dangerous, requiring a quest.
            Reaching this item or ruin should
            require a full session.</item>

        <item>Well Connected (WILL):On first entering a settlement,
            a Merchant can spend an hour
            spreading word of their arrival,
            then roll Well Connected at a
            DC based on the settlement.
            Success raises their reputation
            in that settlement by a number equal to the amount you
            rolled over the DC divided by 2
            (minimum 1), for 1d6 Weeks.</item>

        <item>Fence (INT):A Merchant who has to get
            rid of a dubious or stolen item
            can make a Fence roll at a DC
            determined by the GM. If they
            succeed, they sell the item (at
            full market price) to a buyer who won’t ask any serious
            questions and won’t turn them in to the Guard.</item>

        <item>Warrior Debt (EMP):A Merchant can roll Warrior’s
            Debt to call on a fighter who
            owes them. Split your roll between the 3 sections on the
            Warrior table in the sidebar.
            This warrior will work for you
            for a number of days equal to
            your Warrior’s Debt value and
            takes any reasonable order you
            give without asking questions.</item>

    <string-array name="priest_skills_info">

        <item>Divine Power:A Priest can become more in
            tune with their god, gaining 1
            point of Vigor threshold per
            skill level in Divine Power. This brings your
            Vigor threshold to a total of 12 at level 10.
            Divine Power can be trained
            like other skills and stacks with
            Nature Attunement. The Vigor
            thresholds are not separate.</item>

        <item>Divine Authority (EMP):Peasants and the common
            folk of the world see Priests as
            agents of the gods’ will. A Priest
            can add their Divine Authority to their Leadership rolls if
            they are in an area where their
            religion is worshipped. Even
            when outside such areas of
            worship a Priest adds half this
            value, due to their presence.</item>

        <item>Precognition (WILL):At the will of the GM, a Priest
            can be overcome by visions of
            the future, sending them into
            a catatonic state for 3 rounds.
            After this time the Priest can
            roll Precognition at a DC set
            by the GM to decipher the visions that they are stricken by.
            Such visions are composed of
            symbolism and metaphors.</item>

        <item>Nature Attunement:A Priest can become more in
            tune with nature, gaining 1
            point of Vigor threshold per
            skill level in Nature Attunement. This brings your Vigor
            threshold to a total of 12 at level 10. Nature Attunement can
            be trained like other skills and
            stacks with Divine Power. The
            Vigor thresholds are not separate.</item>

        <item>Read Nature (INT):When in a purely
            natural environment a druid can roll Read
            Nature at a DC set by the GM.
            On a success, the druid reads
            the signs around them to learn
            everything that passed through
            that area and what they did in
            the area. Read Nature renders
            a very localized picture and
            cannot track things.</item>

        <item>Animal Compact (WILL):Druid adds
            Animal Compact to any Wilderness
            Survival rolls they make to handle
            animals. A Druid can also make
            a compact with an animal. By
            taking a full round and rolling
            Animal Compact, they make
            one Beast or animal their ally
            for a number of hours equal to
            their Animal Compact value.
            Monsters are unaffected.</item>

        <item>Blood Rituals (WILL):A Priest casting a ritual can
            make a Blood Ritual check
            against the casting DC of the
            ritual. If they succeed, they can
            cast the ritual without required
            alchemical substances by sacrificing
            5 HP in blood per missing
            alchemical substance. This
            blood can come from others,
            but must be spilled at the time
            of the ritual.</item>

        <item>Fervor (EMP):A Priest can roll Fervor against
            a target’s current INTx3. On
            success, the rallying power of
            the Priest’s words grants 1d6
            temporary health for every
            point rolled over the DC (maximum 5). This lasts for as many
            rounds as their Fervor x2 and
            only works once per target per day.</item>

        <item>Word of God (EMP):A Priest can roll Word of God
            to convince people that they
            are speaking directly for the
            gods. Anyone who fails a Resist
            Coercion roll sees the Priest as
            a messiah and follows along as
            an apostle. A Priest can have as
            many apostles as their Word
            of God value. In combat, use
            bandit stats for apostles without stats.</item>

    <string-array name="witcher_skills_info">

        <item>Meditation:A Witcher can enter a
            meditative trance which grants all the
            benefits of sleeping but allows
            them to remain vigilant. While
            meditating a Witcher is considered awake for the purpose
            of noticing anything within
            double their Meditation value
            in meters.</item>

        <item>Magical Source:As a Witcher uses signs more
            often their body becomes
            more used to the effort. For
            every 2 points a Witcher has
            in Magical Source they gain
            1 points of Vigor threshold.
            When this ability reaches level 10, your maximum Vigor
            threshold becomes 7. This skill
            can be trained like other skills.</item>

        <item>Heliotrope (WILL):When a Witcher is targeted by
            a spell, invocation, or hex they
            can roll Heliotrope to attempt
            to negate the effects. They must
            roll a Heliotrope roll that equals
            or beats the opponent’s roll and
            expend an amount of Stamina
            equal to half the Stamina spent
            to cast the magic.</item>

        <item>Iron Stomach:After decades of drinking toxic
            witcher potions, witcher bodies adapt to the toxins.
            A witcher can endure 5% more toxicity from drinking potions and
            decoctions per 2 points they
            spend on Iron Stomach. This
            skill can be trained like other
            skills. At level 10, a witcher’s
            maximum toxicity is 150%.</item>

        <item>Frenzy:When poisoned, a witcher
            goes into a frenzy and deals an
            extra 1 melee damage per level
            in Frenzy. While in a Frenzy,
            your single goal is to get to a
            place of safety or kill the target
            that poisoned you. When the
            poison wears off, the Frenzy
            ends. You can attempt to end
            Frenzy early with a DC:15 Endurance roll.</item>

        <item>Transmutation (BODY):When taking decoctions a
            Witcher can roll Transmutation at DC-18. A success allows
            their body to assimilate slightly more of the mutagen than
            usual and gain a bonus based
            on which decoction they take.
            The decoction lasts half as long
            as it normally would. The extra mutations
            are too subtle to spot.</item>

        <item>Parry Arrows (DEX):A Witcher can
            roll Parry Arrows at a -3 to deflect physical
            projectiles. When parrying,
            the Witcher can choose a target
            within 10m. That target must
            take a defense action against
            the Witcher’s Parry Arrows
            roll or be Staggered by the flying projectile. </item>

        <item>Quick Strike (REF):After a Witcher takes their
            turn they can spend 5 STA
            and make a Quick Strike roll
            at a DC equal to their opponent’s REFx3. On success, they
            make another single strike in
            that round. This attack must
            be made against the opponent
            they rolled against, but can include disarms,
            trips, and other attacks.</item>

        <item>Whirl (REF):By spending 5 STA per round,
            a witcher can enter a Whirl,
            where the witcher makes one
            attack against everyone within
            sword range each turn, with
            their Whirl roll acting as the
            attack roll. The witcher can only
            maintain this Whirl, dodge,
            and move 2m each round. Doing
            anything else or being hit
            halts the Whirl.</item>

    <string name="profession_skill_tree_help">
         Each Profession in the Witcher TRPG has
        a Profession Skill Tree which offers many
        variations on the core Profession. Each
        tree has three paths that represent different approaches to that Profession. At the
        very bottom is the starting ability for the
        Profession. As you proceed through the
        game you can use Improvement Points to
        travel down any of these paths, or venture
        down all of them a bit. When you have 5
        points in an ability, you can use the next
        ability in that Profession Path at a value of
        0.\n\n

        Gaining points for each new ability works
        the same as gaining points in any new skill.
        You can go from your core skill down any
        one of the three paths, but it must be along
        the path (For example: Core Skill to A1,
        B1 or C1). You cannot hop from one path
        to another, so if you have points in A3 and
        want to get to B3, you must work your way
        all the way up Profession Path B. This allows
        you to play multiple variations of the same
        Profession and gives you lots of useful perks
        to pursue.
