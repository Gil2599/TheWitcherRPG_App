         1. Defining Skill\n
        Each profession has a defining skill. This
        one skill separates this profession from all
        of the others—an ability that only a person
        with years of training in that field can acquire.
        The defining skill is counted in the
        profession skill package when buying skills.\n\n

        2. Vigor\n
        Each profession has a starting allowance of
        Vigor, which represents how much primal
        chaos you can channel through your body
        safely to cast spells, perform rituals, and
        inflict hexes.\n\n

        3. Magic Perks\n
        Professions with inherent magic have magic
        perks. These are spells, incantations, hexes,
        rituals, and signs.\n\n

        4. Skill Package\n
        Each profession has a skill package which
        represents general learning over the course
        of an apprenticeship.\n\n

        5. Starting Gear\n
        Each profession has starting gear that you
        can choose from. This are items that you
        would probably have and use in your daily
        life, working in that profession.\n\n

    <string-array name="defSkills_data_array">

        <item>Busking (EMP):A Bard is a wonderful thing to have around,
            especially when the party’s low on money. A
            Bard can take an hour and make a Busking
            roll in the nearest town center. The total of
            this roll is the amount of money raked in by
            the Bard while they perform on the street. A
            fumble can lower the roll, and a negative value
            means that not only do you fail to make any
            coin but you are also harassed by the locals
            for your poor performance, resulting in a -2
            to Charisma with anyone in the town for the
            rest of the day</item>

        <item>Practiced Paranoia (INT):Whether they’re an assassin, a thief,
            a counterfeiter, or a smuggler, criminals all share a practiced
            paranoia that keeps them out of trouble.
            Whenever a Criminal comes within 10m of a
            trap (this includes experimental traps, Man at
            Arms booby traps, and ambushes) they immediately can make a Practiced Paranoia roll at
            either the DC to spot the trap, the ambushing
            party’s Stealth roll, or a DC set by the GM.
            Even if they don’t succeed in spotting the trap,
            they are still aware that something is wrong</item>

        <item>Patch Job (CRA):A skilled craftsman can patch a weapon or
            armor well enough to keep it working and
            keep its wearer/wielder in the fight, whether
            that be by tying a bowstring back together, sharpening the edge of a broken blade or
            nailing a plate over a cracked shield. By taking
            a turn to roll Patch Job at a DC equal to the
            item’s Crafting DC -3 a Craftsman can restore
            a broken shield or armor to 1/2 its full SP or
            restore a broken weapon to 1/2 its durability.
            Until fixed at a forge, a patched weapon does
            half its normal damage.</item>

        <item>Healing Hands (CRA):Anyone can apply some ointment and wrap
            a bandage around a cut, but a Doctor has
            true medical training which allows them to
            perform complex surgeries. A Doctor with
            Healing Hands is the only person who can
            heal a critical wound. To heal critical wounds
            a doctor must make a number of successful
            Healing Hands rolls based on the severity of
            the critical wound. The DC of the roll is based
            on the severity of the critical wound as well.
            Healing Hands can also be used for any First
            Aid task.</item>

        <item>Magic Training (INT):To qualify as a Mage a magically
            adept person must pass through the halls of one of the
            world’s magical academies and learn the
            fundamentals of the magical arts. A Mage can roll
            Magical Training whenever they encounter
            a magical phenomenon, an unknown spell,
            or a question of magical theory. The DC is set
            by the GM, and a success allows the Mage to
            learn everything there is to know about the
            phenomenon. Magical Training can also
            be rolled as a form of Awareness that detects
            magic that is in use, or specters.</item>

        <item>Tough As Nails (BODY):True Men At Arms like the Blue
            Stripes of Temeria and the Impera Brigade of Nilfgaard are
            hardened soldiers who never give in or surrender.
            When a Man At Arms falls to or below 0 Health, they can roll Tough As Nails at
            a DC equal to the number of negative Health
            times 2 to keep fighting. If they fail, they fall
            into death state as per usual. If they succeed
            they can keep fighting as if they were only at
            their Wound Threshold. Any damage forces
            them to make another roll against a DC based
            on their Health.</item>

        <item>Initiate of the Gods (EMP):The churches of the world are often warm
            and inviting places, helping their communities and welcoming new converts. A Priest
            can roll Initiate of the Gods at a DC set by
            the GM at churches of the same faith to get
            free lodging, healing, and other services at
            the GM’s discretion. Initiate of the Gods also
            works when dealing with members of the
            same faith, though they will likely be able to
            offer less than a fully supplied church. Keep in
            mind that Initiate of the Gods does not work
            with members of other faiths.</item>

        <item>Rite of Oak and Mistletoe (INT):A Druid learns very quickly
            how to harvest magically potent plants and turn them into a
            powerful focus for their magic which connects them to the land
            around them. A Druid can take a day and make a Rite of Oak and
            Mistletoe roll against a DC specific to the area in which they
            find themselves to harvest the necessary ingredients. If successful,
            the Druid creates a Staff which works only for the Druid. This
            staff functions exactly as a Staff (Witcher Core Rule Book, pg. 74)
            but its Focus value rises as they improve their Rite of Oak and Mistletoe
            value. The Focus value begins at 1 at level 1 and raises by 1 every 2
            levels to a maximum of 4 at level 7. At level 9, the Staff gains the
            Greater Focus Effect. Additionally, while the Druid is carrying their staff, they
            gain the following benefits based on their Rite of Oak and Mistletoe value.
            At level 2, the Druid ignores all environmental penalties in overgrown
            or swampy terrain. At level 4, the Druid ignores the penalties for snow and
            ice conditions. At level 6, the Druid ignores the penalties for extreme heat
            conditions. At Level 8, the Druid ignores all penalties from being
            underwater. At Level 10, the Druid can roll to create a new staff by
            taking a full round action rather than 1 day. The DCs to create a staff
            are 14 when in a forest, 16 when in swampy areas, 18 when in mountainous
            regions, and 20 when at sea.</item>

        <item>Witcher Training (INT):Most of a Witcher’s early life is spent within
            the walls of their keep, studying huge, dusty
            tomes and going through hellish combat
            training. Many have argued that the Witcher’s
            greatest weapon is their knowledge of monsters
            and their adaptability in any situation.
            When in a hostile environment or difficult
            terrain, a Witcher can lessen the penalties by
            half their Witcher Training value (minimum
            1). Witcher Training can also be used in any
            situation that you would normally use Monster Lore for</item>

        <item>Well Traveled (INT):Your average merchant makes a living from
            trade and that trade brings in customers
            from all around. But a traveling merchant
            goes to their customers, wandering the roads
            of the world, and learning from it’s people.
            A Merchant can make a Well Traveled roll
            anytime they want to know a fact about a
            specific item, culture, or area. The DC is set
            by the GM and if the roll is successful the
            Merchant remembers the answer to that
            question, calling on memories of the last time
            they travelled through the applicable area.</item>

        <item>Notoriety:Nobility, whether earned by noble deeds or
            conferred by birth, grants a person a grandeur
            that must be acknowledged. Peasants may
            curse a noble\’s name and mock them in the
            safety of their hovels but most dare not insult
            a noble to their face. A Noble adds their Notoriety
            value to their Reputation score when
            in their home country or a country allied with
            their homeland. If a Noble travels to a kingdom or
            territory that is actively at war with, or
            neutral toward their homeland, they gain only
            half their Notoriety value.</item>

        <item>Intolerance (WILL):Peasants are a fearful lot and often for good
            reason. There\’s a lot out in the world that could
            easily kill them. Fear can be fuel for strength,
            however. When first encountering a sapient
            being with a Social Standing of Feared or
            Hated, they can make an Intolerance
            roll against a DC equal to the target\’s
            EMPx3. If the peasant succeeds, their fear
            turns to rage and grants them a bonus to
            Resist Coercion and Courage equal to their
            Intolerance value vs. that being for the
            remainder of the encounter. The Peasant also gains a bonus equal to half their
            Intolerance value to Leadership when rallying
            other peasants.</item>

        <item>Return Act (EMP):Before attempting a Busking

            a name for themselves in this
            town already. Not only is their
            Busking income doubled but
            they gain a +2 Charisma with
            everyone in at that venue.</item>

        <item>Raise A Crowd (EMP):By taking a full round
            to perform, you can roll Raise A
            Crowd to captivate anyone
            within 20m. Anyone who
            doesn’t make a Resist Coercion
            roll higher than your initial roll
            can do nothing but watch you
            perform until they succeed at
            rolling above your initial roll. If
            attacked a target will snap out
            of it.</item>

        <item>Good Friend (EMP):Once per session a Bard can
            make a Good Friend roll to
            find a friend to aid them. Take
            the total roll and split these
            points up between the 3 categories in the Good Friend
            chart in the sidebar. This is friend
            will do one reasonable thing
            for old times’ sake, then cannot
            be called on again for free and
            must be convinced.</item>

        <item>Fade (INT):A Bard can make a Fade
            roll against multiple targets’
            Awareness rolls to fade into
            the background. This ability allows a Bard to hide even
            when there are no good hiding
            places, by slipping into a conversation, drawing attention to
            something else, or the like. This
            ability doesn’t work if you are
            wearing really flashy clothing.</item>

        <item>Spread The Word (INT):A Bard who rolls a successful
            Deceit roll against a target can
            then roll Spread the Word
            against the target’s Resist Coercion roll. If they succeed the
            target spreads the Bard’s lie
            around the target’s settlement
            or group, giving the Bard a +2
            to Deceit when trying to pass
            off that lie again to someone
            else.</item>

        <item>Acclimatize (INT):When in a settlement a Bard
            can roll Acclimatize (See Acclimatize chart for DC).
            If successful, the Bard learns how to
            appear as a local and will no
            longer be treated as an outsider. This grants
            a +2 to Charisma and Persuasion with locals
            and means that they won’t be
            questioned or harassed like an
            outsider.</item>

        <item>Poison The Well (EMP):A Bard can make a Poison
            The Well roll against a target’s
            EMPx3 when they are trying to influence a person or
            people. If successful, the Bard
            makes a pointed comment that
            imposes a -1 for each point
            they rolled above the DC to the
            target’s Seduction, Persuasion,
            Leadership, Intimidation or
            Charisma rolls.</item>

        <item>Needling (EMP):A Bard can make a Needling
            roll against a target’s Resist
            Coercion roll. If successful,
            the bard goads them with obscenities and threats until they
            attack. The target takes a negative to their attack and defense
            equal to half the Bard’s Needling value, lasting for as many
            rounds as the Needling value.</item>

        <item>Et Tu Brute (EMP):A Bard can roll Et Tu Brute
            against a target’s WILLx3 to
            turn them against one ally. If
            successful the Bard’s lies and
            half-truths makes the target
            treat that ally with mistrust and
            animosity for as many days as
            the Et Tu Brute value or until
            they make a Resist Coercion
            roll that beats the Et Tu Brute
            roll.</item>

        <item>Extensive Catalogue (INT):A skilled Craftsman can keep a
            mental catalogue of diagrams
            in their head at all times. When
            a Craftsman has memorized
            as many diagrams as they can,
            they may roll Extensive Catalogue at DC-15 to memorize
            one more. There is no limit, but
            every 10 diagrams they have
            memorized adds 1 to the DC.</item>

        <item>Journeyman (CRA):A Craftsman who begins crafting
            an item can roll Journeyman at a DC equal to the item’s
            crafting DC. If they succeed
            they add +1 DMG for weapons
            or +1 SP for armor for every
            2 points they rolled above the
            DC. The maximum bonus
            they can give to DMG or SP is 5.</item>

        <item>Master Crafting (CRA):Master Crafting allows a
            Craftsman to make items that
            are master grade. They can also
            roll a Master Crafting roll at
            any time at a DC equal to the
            item’s crafting DC to permanently grant armor resistance

            in their head at all times. When
            a Craftsman has memorized
            as many formulae as they can,
            they may roll Mental Pharmacy at DC-15 to memorize one
            more. There is no limit, but
            every 10 formulae they have
            memorized adds 1 to the DC.</item>

        <item>Double Dose (CRA):Any time a craftsman sets out
            to make an alchemical item
            they can make a Double Dose
            roll at a DC equal to the formula’s crafting DC. If they succeed
            they create two units of the
            formula with the ingredients
            of one. This applies to all items
            created with alchemy, including potions, oils, decoctions,
            and bombs.</item>

            an Adaptation check (3 + the crafting
            DC) before making a witcher
            potion to lower its DC to avoid
            poisoning by 1 for every point
            over the crafting DC. If they
            fail, the potion comes out as
            poisonous as it normally would
            be. The DC to avoid poisoning
            can never be lower than 12.</item>

            Augmentation roll at a DC
            listed in the Augmentation
            chart to augment a weapon
            or Armor with their crafting
            tools. This augmentation takes
            3 rounds. While a forge isn’t required,
            it grants a +2 to the roll.
            A fumble results in the item
            taking damage equal to the
            fumble value.</item>

        <item>Silver Coating (CRA):A Craftsman can
            coat an existing weapon in silver with a
            forge and a number of units
            of silver ingots based on the
            size of the weapon. The DC for

            with a DC equal an item’s crafting
            DC to search for a flaw in

            turn of studying, but allows the
            Craftsman to make a targeted
            attack at a -6 to do ablation
            damage to the armor or weapon equal to half their Pinpoint
            value in 6-sided dice.</item>

            to wander the streets of a Settlement and roll Case the Area
            against a DC in the Case the

            in that area for a number of
            days equal to their Case the
            Area value.</item>

        <item>Mental Key (INT):Whenever a Criminal successfully picks a lock they can roll
            Mental Key at a DC equal to
            the Lock Picking DC to memorize its tumbler positions.
            This allows the Criminal to
            open the lock without a Lock
            Picking roll. You can memorize as many locks as you have
            points in INT and can always

            can roll Go To Ground to find
            a hideout where they can lie
            low for a while. Take the total
            value of your Go to Ground
            roll and split the points between the 3 categories in the
            Go To Ground table in the

        <item>Weak Spot (EMP):A Criminal can roll Weak
            Spot against a sentient target’s
            Deceit roll to identify the target’s most valued possession
            or person. This also grants the
            Criminal a +1 to Intimidate
            for every 2 points they rolled
            above the target’s Deceit. This

            from anyone in their settlement.</item>

        <item>Rally (WILL):Once per day, by taking an
            hour, a Criminal can roll a Rally check against a DC set by the
            GM. For every 2 you roll above
            the DC they recruit 1 Bandit
            for a number of days equal to
            your Rally value. If a Bandit is
            knocked below half health they
            must roll under the Criminal’s
            WILL on a 10 sided die or flee.</item>

        <item>Careful Aim (DEX):A Criminal who’s
            not in active combat and takes a round
            to aim can roll Careful Aim
            at a DC equal to their target’s
            REFx3 to gain a bonus on
            their next attack equal to half
            their Careful Aim value. Being

        <item>Eye Gouge (DEX):A Criminal can roll Eye Gouge
            in place of an attack to temporarily blind a target. Eye Gouge
            requires the Criminal to be in

            If they succeed they assess
            any Critical Wounds the subject has and learn how many

            wounds.</item>

        <item>Analysis (INT):When about to perform a
            Healing Hands roll, a Doctor
            can take a turn to make an
            Analysis roll at a DC equal
            to the severity of the Critical
            Wound. If they succeed they

            to heal a Critical Wound a Doctor can make
            an Effective Surgery roll at a
            DC equal to the wound’s Healing Hands DC. If they succeed
            they treat the wounds so skilfully that they heal twice as

            used on regular wounds.</item>

        <item>Healing Tent (CRA):Healing Tent allows a Doctor
            to roll against a DC set by the
            GM to create a covered area
            that provides an optimal medical environment. This takes 1
            hour but adds +3 to Healing
            Hands/First Aid rolls inside,
            and +2 to the healing rate of

            to the crafting DC for a specific medical alchemical item to
            substitute something else on
            hand for the same effect. This
            roll takes one round and if it
            is failed it can be made again.

            Remedy chart in the sidebar).
            Each remedy remains viable
            for 3 days and must be burned

            with a bladed weapon can
            make a Bleeding Wound roll
            against a DC of 15. On success,
            the attack causes bleeding at
            a rate of 1 point per 2 points

            roll.</item>

        <item>Practical Carnage (INT):A Doctor can roll Practical
            Carnage against a DC equal
            to the opponent’s BODYx3 to

        <item>Crippling Wound (INT):A Doctor can make a Crippling
            Wound roll against the
            target’s defense. This attack
            takes a -6 to hit but imposes
            a negative to the target’s REFLEX, BODY, or SPEED equal
            to 1 per 3 points above their

        <item>Grape Vine (INT):A Mage can take 1 hour and
            make a Grape Vine roll against
            a target’s EMPx3. Success
            spreads rumors throughout a

            number of days equal to your
            Grape Vine value.</item>

        <item>Assets (INT):Once per game a Mage can
            make an Assets roll to remember an asset they ‘acquired’
            some time ago. Take the total of your roll and distribute
            it between the 4 columns on
            the table in the sidebar to find
            out who you know. This asset
            will help you, but how much
            depends on their relationship
            with you.</item>

        <item>Reverse Engineer (INT):By taking 1
            hour to study an alchemical solution a Mage can
            roll Reverse Engineer at a DC
            equal to the Crafting DC for
            the alchemical item +3. Success allows them to
            reverse-engineer and write down the
            item’s formula. this formula is
            3 points harder to craft , but reliably

        <item>Distillation (CRA):A Mage can roll Distillation
            instead of Alchemy when creating an alchemical solution.

            to mutate the subject. Success
            grants the subject use of the
            Mutagen with the appropriate minor mutation. Failure

        <item>In Touch:As a Mage utilizes magic
            more and more, their body
            becomes more used to the
            flow. Every point a Mage has
            in In Touch grants +2 points
            to Vigor threshold. When this
            ability reaches level 10 your
            maximum Vigor threshold
            becomes 25. This skill can be
            trained, like other skills.</item>

        <item>Immutable (WILL):A Mage can roll Immutable at
            DC-16 whenever they would
            normally be affected by dimeritium.
            Success means that
            the Mage mostly shrugs off
            the dimeritium. They are still
            somewhat dizzy and uncomfortable but retain half of their
            total Vigor threshold and can
            perform magic.</item>

        <item>Expanded Magic (WILL):By channelling magic through
            various magical foci a Mage
            can wield incredible power. A
            Mage can roll Expanded Magic before attempting to cast a
            spell or ritual, at a DC of 16.
            On success the mage can channel the spell or ritual through
            any 2 of their foci that they
            choose, reducing the Stamina
            cost twice.</item>

            critical with their ranged weapon can immediately roll Pin
            Point Aim at a DC equal to the

            they add their Pin Point Aim

            it. If the Man At Arms loses the

            that can be built. The Man At
            Arms can only build one type
            of trap at a time. Every trap

            at a DC equal to their EMPx3.

            Arms becomes immune to
            fear, spells that change emotions, and Verbal Combat for
            a number of rounds equal to

        <item>Zweihand (BODY):By spending 10 STA and rolling
            Zweihand minus 3 against an opponent’s defense, a Man
            At Arms can make one attack
            which does double damage
            and has armor piercing. If the
            weapon already has armor
            piercing, it gains improved armor piercing. A weapon with

            spend 10 STA to immediately
            roll Shrug It Off when an enemy strikes a Critical Wound on

            rolled a critical.</item>

            If they succeed the Merchant
            finds another person selling
            the same item for half the price.
            The higher the item rarity, the

            they succeed the salesperson
            accepts the Merchant’s promise
            to pay for the item later. This
            promise holds the salesperson
            over for a number of weeks
            equal to your Promise ability.</item>

        <item>Rookery (EMP):A Merchant can make a

            the aid of 1 urchin or vagrant
            per 1 point they rolled over
            the DC (maximum 10). These
            people can be consulted to
            grant +1 per person on Streetwise rolls. Informants take 1

        <item>Insider (INT):A Merchant with Insider can
            convince a person to spy for
            them. Spend 10 crowns and

            the supposed location of a relic
            item, or a ruin that may hide
            something useful. This location will, of course, be out of
            the way or exceedingly dangerous, requiring a quest.
            Reaching this item or ruin should
            require a full session.</item>

        <item>Well Connected (WILL):On first entering a settlement,
            a Merchant can spend an hour
            spreading word of their arrival,
            then roll Well Connected at a
            DC based on the settlement.

            Divine Power can be trained
            like other skills and stacks with

            folk of the world see Priests as
            agents of the gods’ will. A Priest
            can add their Divine Authority to their Leadership rolls if
            they are in an area where their
            religion is worshipped. Even
            when outside such areas of

        <item>Precognition (WILL):At the will of the GM, a Priest
            can be overcome by visions of
            the future, sending them into

            attracts people and converts them to their religion.
            The GM determines how many people join. Additionally, while

            make a Blood Ritual check

            ritual. If they succeed, they can
            cast the ritual without required
            alchemical substances by sacrificing
            5 HP in blood per missing
            alchemical substance. This

            of the ritual.</item>

        <item>Fervor (EMP):A Priest can roll Fervor against
            a target’s current INTx3. On
            success, the rallying power of
            the Priest’s words grants 1d6
            temporary health for every
            point rolled over the DC (maximum 5). This lasts for as many
            rounds as their Fervor x2 and
            only works once per target per day.</item>

        <item>Word of God (EMP):A Priest can roll Word of God
            to convince people that they
            are speaking directly for the

            Coercion roll sees the Priest as
            a messiah and follows along as
            an apostle. A Priest can have as
            many apostles as their Word
            of God value. In combat, use

        <item>Read Nature (INT):When in a purely natural environment,
            a Druid can roll Read Nature at a DC set by the GM. On a

            everything that passed through that area within the last
            week and what each creature did in the area. Read Nature
            renders a very localized picture and cannot track things
            but gives a very detailed description of what happened in
            the area.</item>

        <item>Animal Compact (WILL):A Druid adds their Animal Compact
            value to any Wilderness Survival rolls they make to handle

            Ability in place of any Wilderness Survival, Monster
            Lore, Human Perception, or Education checks.</item>

        <item>Blood and Bones (WILL):By casting bones in a bowl filled with
            blood drawn from a person, the Druid can alter the fate of that
            person. The Druid rolls Blood and Bones against a DC-10 + the
            target\'s WILL. On a success, the target can add half the Druid\'s
            Blood and Bones value to one check made before the next sunrise.
            On a failure, the target cannot benefit from this ability for 1 week.
            A single target can only benefit from this ability once per session.</item>

        <item>Bestial Form:Unlocking ancient rituals allows the Druid to
            incorporate animal aspects into their body, transforming into
            a hybrid form without taking an action. For each 2 levels the
            Druid has in Bestial Form, they can add a new animalistic aspect
            to their hybrid form. Additionally, while in their hybrid form,

            a sacred grove. This takes 1 hour, and covers an area with a
            20m radius. The Druid takes the value of their Sacred Grove check
            and uses those points to add protections to their sacred grove.
            The Druid and anyone they specify are immune to these protections.
            This grove lasts for 3 months and the Druid can maintain a number
            of groves equal to their Sacred Grove value.</item>

        <item>Grove Guardian (WILL):By using an ancient ritual, the Druid can
            empower an animal or beast. By taking one full round and rolling Grove
            Guardian against a DC-10 + the creature\'s BODY, the creature
            grows to twice its size, its BODY increases by 5, and gains a +5
            bonus to damage. This bonus affects the creatures Derived Statistics
            as well. The creature also becomes highly aggressive to enemies of the

        <item>Magical Source:As a Witcher uses signs more
            often their body becomes
            more used to the effort. For
            every 2 points a Witcher has
            in Magical Source they gain

            decoctions per 2 points they
            spend on Iron Stomach. This
            skill can be trained like other

        <item>Frenzy:When poisoned, a witcher
            goes into a frenzy and deals an
            extra 1 melee damage per level
            in Frenzy. While in a Frenzy,
            your single goal is to get to a
            place of safety or kill the target

            Witcher can roll Transmutation at DC-18. A success allows
            their body to assimilate slightly more of the mutagen than
            usual and gain a bonus based
            on which decoction they take.
            The decoction lasts half as long
            as it normally would. The extra mutations
            are too subtle to spot.</item>

        <item>Parry Arrows (DEX):A Witcher can
            roll Parry Arrows at a -3 to deflect physical
            projectiles. When parrying,
            the Witcher can choose a target
            within 10m. That target must
            take a defense action against
            the Witcher’s Parry Arrows
            roll or be Staggered by the flying projectile. </item>

        <item>Quick Strike (REF):After a Witcher takes their
            turn they can spend 5 STA
            and make a Quick Strike roll
            at a DC equal to their opponent’s REFx3. On success, they
            make another single strike in
            that round. This attack must
            be made against the opponent
            they rolled against, but can include disarms,
            trips, and other attacks.</item>

        <item>Whirl (REF):By spending 5 STA per round,
            a witcher can enter a Whirl,
            where the witcher makes one
            attack against everyone within
            sword range each turn, with
            their Whirl roll acting as the
            attack roll. The witcher can only
            maintain this Whirl, dodge,
            and move 2m each round. Doing
            anything else or being hit
            halts the Whirl.</item>

    <string-array name="noble_skills_info">

        <item>Dabble:Each time a Noble buys a
            rank in Dabble, they gain
            two free skill points to
            spend. These points must be
            spent to buy a rank in a skill
            the Noble has zero ranks in
            and cannot raise a skill\’s value beyond rank one. To buy
            a Difficult skill at rank 1, the
            Noble must spend both free
            points.</item>

        <item>Expert Guise (EMP):By rolling Expert Guise
            against a target’s Resist Coercion, the
            Noble can permanently convince a person
            of the Noble\’s expertise in a
            specific subject. The target
            then defers to the Noble and
            the Noble gains a +3 to Deceit checks against the target
            when that specific topic is
            involved.</item>

        <item>Host (EMP):By taking a day and spending an amount of money
            equal to their Host value
            times 100, a Noble can arrange a festive gathering.
            While at this gathering, the
            Noble gains a +3 to Charisma, Seduction, and Persuasion. Anyone the Noble
            invites must make a Resist
            Coercion check against the
            Noble\’s Host check to not
            attend. </item>

        <item>Command (WILL):As an action, a Noble can
            command a target to perform a specific task on their
            next turn. If the Noble\’s
            Command check beats a
            DC equal to the target’s
            WILLx3, the target gains a
            bonus to one check involved
            in this task equal to one-half
            the Noble\’s Command value
            (minimum 1).</item>

        <item>Servants:A Noble gains a number of
            servants equal to half their
            Servants value (minimum
            1). These subjects follow the
            Noble\’s orders to the best
            of their ability but must be
            commanded or persuaded
            to risk their lives. If a servant can no longer serve for
            any reason, the Noble can
            request a new one from
            their household be sent.</item>

        <item>Estate:A Noble personally owns an
            estate that consists of a main
            house, a stable, and a parcel
            of land. The Noble decides
            where this estate is located
            (within reason). The Noble
            serves as the land\’s manager and gains benefit from it.
            Anyone living on the land is
            their subject. More details
            can be found on page 12.</item>

        <item>Resolute:A Noble can add their
            Resolute value to their Courage
            and Resist Coercion checks.
            If they succeed a Courage
            or Resist Coercion check,
            any ally who witnesses them
            do so gains a bonus on their
            own Courage or Resist Coercion check equal
            to onehalf the Noble\’s Resolute
            value (minimum 1) until
            the end of the scene.</item>

        <item>Chevalier (EMP):By taking an hour, a Noble
            can make a Chevalier check
            against a mount\’s WILLx3
            to permanently bond with
            it. When being ridden by
            the Noble, the mount\’s Control Modifier is raised by
            half the Noble\’s Chevalier
            value. The Noble can also
            lower the result of a control
            loss by half this value.</item>

        <item>Armored Buffer (REF):If an enemy scores a critical
            wound on a Noble, the Noble can immediately make
            an Armored Buffer check
            against a DC equal to the
            enemy\’s original Attack
            Check. If the Noble succeeds, they can negate the
            critical wound by sacrificing
            the armor in the hit location. The armor suffers 1d10
            ablation damage per level of
            the critical wound to the hit
            location.</item>

    <string-array name="peasant_skills_info">

        <item>Harvest Time:Knowing the proper time and
            way to harvest a crop is a skill
            that takes years to master. When
            foraging for plant-based alchemical components the peasant
            gains an extra number of units
            equal to half their HarvestTime
            value (Minimum 1).</item>

        <item>Animal Whisper (EMP):By taking an action, the Peasant
            can roll an Animal Whisperer check against a DC equal to
            the animal\’s WILLx3, to convey commands and requests
            to any domesticated animal. If
            the check succeeds, the animal
            carries out these commands to
            the best of its ability.</item>

        <item>Farm Wisdom (CRA):While magic may not be a talent for everyone, there are some
            tricks that the layperson can
            learn to tip the scale of life in their
            favor. A Peasant can take one action and roll Farm Wisdom to
            perform one of the folk rituals
            in the sidebar. Each ritual has its
            own DC and requirements.</item>

        <item>Butchery (CRA):When a Peasant loots a monster
            or animal with a physical form,
            they can roll a Butchery roll at
            a DC based on the beasts complexity. If they succeed, they are
            able to gain the maximum number of units of one organic loot
            item from the animal. This roll
            can be made multiple times on
            a single corpse but the peasant
            cannot make two attempts on
            the same part of the beast.</item>

        <item>Cure All (CRA):By taking 10 minutes and using
            one unit of three different types
            of alchemical component, the
            Peasant can create a folk cure all.
            This concoction has a percentage chance of curing the person
            who consumes it of the poison, intoxication, and nausea conditions. The percentage is equal
            to the Peasant\’s Cure All value
            times 5%. This Cure All lasts for
            24 hours before going bad. Once
            used, this cure all is consumed.</item>

        <item>Ma\’s Stew (CRA):Once per day, if a Peasant has
            access to cooking tools and the
            ingredients required, they can
            spend 1 hour to create a stew
            from an old family recipe. This
            stew is large enough to feed 6
            people and its effects are based
            on what basic ingredients are
            added (See the table in the sidebar). Effects conferred by the
            stew last for a full 24 hours.</item>

        <item>Ditch Digger:Years of manual labor have
            strengthened the Peasant’s body
            and taught them technique to
            make even the most grueling
            labor manageable. The Peasant
            adds double their Ditch Digger
            value to their ENC. Also, when
            making Physique or Endurance
            rolls to perform manual labor,
            the Peasant can add half their
            Ditch Digger value.</item>

        <item>Grog (CRA):A peasant knows how to get the
            most out of any brew. By taking
            an action to mix one unit of an
            alchemical component with a
            serving of alcohol, a Peasant can
            make a Grog roll at a DC of 14.
            If the Peasant succeeds anyone
            who drinks the alcohol must
            make an Endurance check at a
            DC equal to the peasant\’s Grog
            value plus 12 or become intoxicated. Once the peasant has a
            Grog value of 5, the effects of the
            intoxication condition are doubled.</item>

        <item>Bite The Ear (BODY):When grappled or pinned by a
            creature or person, the Peasant
            can take an action to make a Bite
            the Ear roll against the target\’s
            DEXx3. If the peasant succeeds
            they bite off part of the ear (or
            other superficial body part) of
            the target, breaking the grapple/
            pin immediately, dealing 1d6
            unmodified damage, and giving the target a permanent -1 to
            Charisma and Seduction checks.</item>

    <string name="profession_skill_tree_help">
        This is the profession skill tree section.
        Each Profession in the Witcher TRPG has
        a Profession Skill Tree which offers many
        variations on the core Profession. Click and hold
        on any skill to see its description. You may need to
        manually adjust any skills or modifiers that a particular
        profession skill affects. Vigor will be adjusted automatically
        when applicable.\n\n

        Gaining points for each new ability works
        the same as gaining points in any new skill.
        You can go from your core skill down any
        one of the three paths, but it must be along
        the path (For example: Core Skill to A1,
        B1 or C1). You cannot hop from one path
        to another, so if you have points in A3 and
        want to get to B3, you must work your way
        all the way up Profession Path B. This allows
        you to play multiple variations of the same
        Profession and gives you lots of useful perks
        to pursue.
