        <item>Wrath of nature:14:Wrath of nature allows you to summon the
        tremendous power of the natural world to wreak
        havoc on your enemies. Depending on the terrain,
        Wrath of nature creates a different effect centered on you with a 60m radius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        Fields- Every turn you can spend a full round action to either touch down
        a rope tornado within 10m of you or direct a single rope tornado within
        the area of the storm. A rope tornado covers a 4m cubed area and when
        directed by you can move 10m per turn. If it runs over or into targets
        those targets must make Athletics checks against your Spell Casting check.
        If they fail, they take 4d6 dam- age to the torso and are knocked back 10m
        in a direction decided by the GM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        Mountains- Every turn you can spend a full round action to summon
        down a bolt of lightning which strikes a target. The target must
        make a Dodge/Escape or Athletics check against your Spell Casting
        check or take 6d6 damage to the torso and have a 50% chance of being
        lit on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        Underground- Every turn you can spend a full round action
        to summon a stalagmite or stalactite to violently erupt from the stone
        and stab a single target. The target of this attack must make a Dodge/Escape,
        Athletics, or Block check against your Spell Casting check or take 5d6 damage.
        Each summoned stalagmite or stalactite remains until destroyed and counts as
        a 2m cubed piece of cover with 20 SP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        Forest- Every turn you can spend a full round action to either summon
        up a tangle of roots from the ground to take one of the following
        actions or give a single command to each existing tangle of roots
        you have summoned. These roots are immobile but have the Long Reach
        Effect and can be used to Grapple, Trip, Disarm, Choke, or Pin a
        target. They have a Brawling base of 16 unless your Spell Casting
        base would be higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        Swamp- Every turn you can spend a full round action to summon a 6m radius
        area of swamp gas that erupts from the ground. Anyone caught in the gas
        must make an Endurance check against your Spell Casting check or suffer
        from the Disease condition. This gas remains until the invocation ends.
        Additionally, if an exposed flame is present in the area of this gas, it
        explodes, causing every creature in the gas to take 5d6 damage to the torso
        and have a 75% chance of catching on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        Shore- Every turn you can spend a full round action to summon a
        powerful waterspout out of the nearby body of water to knock down
        targets with pressurized water. Two jets of water emit from the spout
        towards one or two targets within 20m. These target\'s must make
        Dodge/Escape or Athletics checks against your Spell Casting check
        or take 3d6 damage and be knocked back 6m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        Desert- Every turn you can spend a full round action to kick up
        a gust of burning sand in a 6m radius area. Any creatures within
        this area must make a Dodge/Escape or Athletics check versus your
        Spell Casting check or be blinded for 5 rounds and be lit on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        Tundra- Every turn you can spend a full round action to summon up
        a whirl of snow and water magic around a single target to encase
        them in ice. The target must make a Dodge/Escape, Athletics, or
        Resist Magic check versus your Spell Casting check or be encased
        in solid ice. This ice immobilizes the target and keeps them from
        taking actions. To break out of this ice, the target must make a
        DC-16 Physique check. Alternatively, if someone deals 10 points of
        damage to the ice or 5 points of fire damage to the ice, it allows
        the person to break free. Any damage beyond the 10 points (or 5 points)
        required to break the ice is dealt to the target\'s torso.
